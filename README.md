# census-income-project
census income project using all Machine learning models for best results

In this project, initially you need to preprocess the data and then develop an understanding of different features of the data by performing exploratory analysis and creating visualizations. Further, after having sufficient knowledge about the attributes you will perform a predictive task of classification to predict whether an individual makes over 50K a year or less, by using different Machine Learning Algorithms.
